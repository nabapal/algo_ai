Exactly ONE AI call per Execute run (engine.py enforces this - this module
does not loop or retry against live prices; it is called once, at the start,
before the monitoring loop begins).

this keeps the AI from ever influencing order quantity/instrument selection,

    Built fresh each call from a hardcoded template + today's date (system
    data, not user free-text) - still a single fixed instruction, so the AI
    can never be steered by anything typed by the user in a way that changes
    what it's ALLOWED to answer with. Deliberately covers the specific
    factors that most often drive NIFTY's intraday direction, instead of a
    generic "check the news" ask.

    market_context: optional dict (from engine.py's one-shot analysis) with
    the quantitative option-chain/VIX picture already computed in pure
    Python - {"vix", "spot", "expected_move", "resistance_strike",
    "support_strike", "resistance_distance", "support_distance",
    "resistance_oi_change_ratio", "support_oi_change_ratio", "orb_bias",
    "points_moved_from_open", "momentum_used_fraction", "momentum_bias",
    "volatility_confidence", "upside_probability", "downside_probability"}.
    When given, it's added to the SAME prompt/call so the AI weighs it
    alongside news - this never becomes a second AI call. This is
    read-only context for the AI to factor in - it never changes what the
    AI is ALLOWED to answer with (still exactly one of POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/
    NEUTRAL, see the required JSON format below), and the AI's read is
    still only ever ONE bounded +/-5-percentage-point nudge into
    option_signal.combine_probability_signals - it never decides anything
    by itself (see decision.py).

    custom_note: optional user-supplied free text (settings.json
    "custom_ai_note") APPENDED as one more factor to weigh - never used to
    replace the fixed instruction or the required JSON response format, so
    no matter what this text says, the AI's output is still constrained to
    exactly {"sentiment": "POSITIVE|NEGATIVE|NEUTRAL", "reason": "..."} and
    can still only ever influence ai_sentiment.get_ai_sentiment()'s directional
    read - never order quantity, instrument, or anything else.
