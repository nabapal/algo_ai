    Phase 6 upgrade (consistency with compute_direction_probability's Phase
    2/3 upgrades): the plain, whole-window PCR treats a strike 5 positions
    away exactly the same as one sitting right next to spot - the same "PCR
    alone isn't enough, it has to be combined with WHERE the nearest strike
    actually is" reasoning already applied to the OI-wall base probability
    also applies to the BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL classification here, or it
    ends up looking artificially "stuck" on NEUTRAL relative to it even
    when the market's immediate vicinity is clearly skewed. When
    spot_price/strike_interval are given, a SEPARATE proximity-weighted PCR
    (`weighted_pcr` in the return value) is computed the same way
    compute_direction_probability does (full weight at spot, zero weight at
    the edge of the tracked ATM+/-window_strikes window) and is what
    actually decides oi_bias - the real, unweighted `pcr` above is left
    untouched for display/verification. Without those extra args (left as
    None), `weighted_pcr` just equals the plain `pcr` and behavior is
    unchanged - existing callers are unaffected.

    Phase 10 upgrade: strike_oi_change_ratios (optional {strike: {"CE": ratio|
    None, "PE": ratio|None}}) folds in the SAME fresh today-vs-yesterday
    OI-change numbers already used for the OI-wall base probability (3b)
    and ATM's own OI-change (Phase 7) - a leg showing heavy fresh build-up
    right now is stronger, more current evidence than its static size alone.
    Only strikes actually present in this dict get reweighted (typically
    just the identified walls + ATM, since that's all the extra API calls
    this project fetches) - every other strike keeps its plain proximity
    weight, clamped the same way as elsewhere (`oi_change_clamp`, default
    +/-50%) so one unusual day's swing can't dominate. Omitting this arg

    WAY, not HOW MUCH). Combines five already-computed, real signals -
    never a fixed/guessed number on its own:

      1. expected_move / avg_range: today's (VIX+historical-blended, Phase 7)
         expected move relative to the recent typical daily range - the
         core "is today unusual" ratio. Mapped to confidence via
         `ratio_scale` (default 50): a ratio of 1.0 (today = typical) maps
         to 50%, a ratio of 2.0 (today implies double the usual range) maps
         to 100%.
      2. ORB breakout bonus (Phase 9): if today's price has ALREADY broken
         out past today's own opening-range high/low (orb_bias != NEUTRAL),
         that's real, confirmed evidence of an active move, not just an
         implied one - adds a flat `orb_bonus` (default 15 points). Replaces
         the old Pivot-R1/S1-breakout bonus (see compute_orb_bias).
      3. Momentum bonus: how much of today's expected move is ALREADY
         realized (momentum_used_fraction, from compute_momentum_bias) -
         scales up to `momentum_scale` (default 20 points) as more of the
         expected range gets used up, since real, already-happening movement
         is itself confidence-building regardless of the VIX ratio.
      4. OI build-up bonus: VIX is a statistical/implied number - it says
         nothing about whether real option-chain positioning is actually
         backing up a big move TODAY. resistance_oi_change_ratio/
         support_oi_change_ratio (today's OI at the two nearest walls vs
         yesterday's close - the exact same numbers already computed for
         the OI-wall probability, see get_oi_change/compute_direction_
         probability) are reused here by their MAGNITUDE, not their sign:
         heavy fresh OI build-up OR unwind near spot, in EITHER direction,
         means real conviction is actively being added or removed right
         now - that is evidence a big move is more likely today, regardless
         of which way. Averaged across whichever of the two walls have a
         ratio available, clamped the same way as the probability signal
         (`oi_change_clamp`, default +/-50%) so one outlier strike can't
         dominate, then scaled to `oi_buildup_scale` (default 15 points) at
         the clamp limit.
      5. CPR-narrowness bonus (Phase 9): cpr_width_ratio (compute_cpr_width's
         result divided by avg_range, see engine.py) is a PRE-MARKET "will
         today trend or chop" classifier from yesterday's H/L/C alone. A
         narrower CPR (ratio closer to 0) historically precedes a bigger
         move - scaled via `1 - cpr_width_ratio/(1/3)` (1/3 being the real,
         derived mathematical maximum of this ratio when using a day's OWN
         high-low as the denominator - see compute_cpr_width - used here as
         the normalization reference, not an invented cutoff), clamped to
         [0, 1], times `cpr_narrow_scale` (default 15 points). A wide CPR
         contributes nothing (never subtracts).

    All five weights (ratio_scale/orb_bonus/momentum_scale/
    oi_buildup_scale/cpr_narrow_scale) are deliberately exposed as tunable
    settings (see settings.json) rather than baked in - this is a reasoned
    combination of real signals, not a backtested/verified formula, so it

    Probability split derived from the OI-wall imbalance above: heavier
    put-writing (support) OI relative to call-writing (resistance) OI means
    sellers are collectively leaning toward the market NOT falling - which
    tilts the odds toward the upside, and vice versa. This is the same
    put/call OI-imbalance idea as PCR, applied specifically to the nearest
    OTM walls instead of the whole ATM+/-5 range.

    Phase 2 upgrade: a wall's raw OI size alone doesn't say how RELEVANT it
    is right now - a heavy wall sitting right next to the current price is
    about to be tested and matters far more than an equally heavy wall
    sitting at the far edge of the tracked ATM+/-window_strikes range, which
    price would have to travel much further to even reach. When
    support_strike/resistance_strike/spot_price/strike_interval are ALL
    given, each wall's OI is weighted by its distance from spot, decaying
    linearly from full weight (wall exactly at spot) to zero weight (wall at
    the edge of the tracked window, window_strikes*strike_interval points
    away):

        proximity = max(0, 1 - |strike - spot_price| / (window_strikes * strike_interval))
        weighted_oi = raw_oi * proximity

    Phase 3 upgrade: a wall's OI size (even proximity-weighted) doesn't say
    whether that conviction is FRESH (being actively added to right now -
    real, current evidence) or STALE/UNWINDING (sellers are actually
    covering, i.e. the wall is getting weaker even if its absolute OI is
    still large). support_oi_change_ratio/resistance_oi_change_ratio -
    today's OI at that wall divided by YESTERDAY's closing OI for that same
    contract (engine.get_oi_change) - scale the weighted OI further:
    ratio > 1 (fresh build-up) strengthens that wall, ratio < 1 (unwinding)
    weakens it. Clamped to [1-oi_change_clamp, 1+oi_change_clamp] (default
    0.5-1.5x) so one unusually large single-day swing can't dominate the
    whole picture on its own.

        upside_probability = weighted_support / (weighted_support + weighted_resistance)

    Without the Phase 2/3 extra args (any left as None), falls back to the
    original pure OI-magnitude comparison - existing callers are unaffected:

        upside_probability = support_oi / (support_oi + resistance_oi)

    Falls back to a neutral 50/50 split if both (weighted) walls are
    zero/unknown - e.g. both walls being right at the edge of the tracked
    window, or the position isn't known.

    floor right under the current price -> BULLISH; relatively faster CALL

    probability - not just the OI-wall ratio alone:

      - base_upside_probability: the OI-wall ratio from compute_direction_probability()
        (the option chain's most direct positioning data - used as the anchor).
      - pcr: the broader ATM+/-5 put/call OI ratio (option chain, distinct from
        the OI walls above) - >1+pcr_threshold nudges bullish, <1-pcr_threshold
        nudges bearish, otherwise no nudge (same threshold as compute_oi_bias).
      - vwap_bias: "BULLISH"/"BEARISH"/"NEUTRAL" - nudges accordingly.
      - orb_bias: "BULLISH"/"BEARISH"/"NEUTRAL" (from compute_orb_bias, Phase 9 -
        today's price vs today's own opening-range high/low) - nudges
        accordingly. This is the same signal used in combine_bias(), now
        also folded into the probability so it isn't a separate,
        disconnected number. Replaces the classic Pivot R1/S1 breakout
        this project used before (see compute_orb_bias's docstring for why).
      - gap: today's open-vs-yesterday's-close in points (from compute_gap_flag) -
        a gap up nudges bullish, a gap down nudges bearish, ~0 is neutral.
      - ai_sentiment: "POSITIVE"/"NEGATIVE"/"NEUTRAL" (news/global-cues read) -
        nudges accordingly.
      - momentum_bias: "BULLISH"/"BEARISH"/"NEUTRAL" (from compute_momentum_bias -
        today's own already-realized move, sized against VIX's expected move)
        - nudges accordingly. Phase 1 of the multi-signal upgrade: the market's
        own price action today is itself evidence, previously computed
        (points_moved_from_open) but never actually used here.
      - atm_oi_bias: "BULLISH"/"BEARISH"/"NEUTRAL" (from compute_atm_oi_change_bias -
        fresh OI build-up/unwind CALL vs PUT specifically at the ATM strike,
        today vs yesterday) - nudges accordingly. Phase 7: distinct from pcr
        above (which is the broader ATM+/-5 window's static ratio) - this is
        what's freshly changing right at the money today.

    Each of the 7 nudging signals shifts the base probability by
    +/-adjustment_per_signal (default 5 percentage points) if it agrees or
    disagrees with the upside direction; a signal that's neutral/unavailable
    contributes no nudge. The result is clamped to [5%, 95%] - this system
    never claims false certainty in either direction.

    India VIX is deliberately NOT a direct input here: it's a volatility/
    magnitude measure, not a directional one on its own, without a
    historical baseline to compare against - its role is sizing the expected
    MOVE (see compute_vix_expected_move) and, via momentum_bias, sizing how
    meaningful today's realized move is - not nudging the probability by
    itself.
